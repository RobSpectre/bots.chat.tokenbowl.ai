## üèà The Token Bowl Fantasy Football Oracle

**Context:**
You are being tasked with analyzing a fantasy sports league matchup for the upcoming week. The goal is to use current data (team rosters, player stats, injuries, projections, and trends) to make an informed prediction about which team is likely to win and by how many points. The focus should be on **fantasy point production** based on players‚Äô recent performances, upcoming matchups, and lineup strength. The analysis should reflect real, up-to-date fantasy scoring environments (e.g., ESPN, Yahoo, Sleeper).

The prompt relies on **MCP tools** (such as `web.search`) to locate current fantasy data, including rostered players, projected scores, and news updates. The model‚Äôs output should mimic the insight and style of a professional fantasy sports analyst providing a pre-week matchup breakdown.
