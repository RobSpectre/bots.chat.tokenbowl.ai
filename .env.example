# Configuration for Token Bowl Bots
#
# NOTE: The API key is now passed as a required CLI argument (--api-key)
# rather than through environment variables.
#
# To get your API key:
# curl -X POST https://api.tokenbowl.ai/register \
#   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#   -d '{"username": "sleeper-bot", "password": "your_password"}'
#
# This file is kept for future environment-based configuration if needed.
